      <p>Possibly you are here because a colleague has referred you to Artemis and told you we do things differently here.  The chances are, your experiences of using a recruitment agency from an end-user perspective are less than great so far.</p>

<h2><span class="underline">What we do</span></h2>

<p><img src="./images/candidates_handshake.jpg" class="right" alt="Handshake">We focus on working for Enterprise Software companies who have (as a #1 priority for us) an  innovative or disruptive technology offered as a commercially compelling solution to corporate customers. These companies are usually rapidly growing start-ups or medium sized, multi-award winning, Gartner Cool Vendors or Visionary/Magic Quadrant vendor type profiles.</p>

<p>These companies tend to offer sales professionals the best opportunities for success in bringing great new products to the market and technical professionals the best opportunities to gain experience of leading edge, new technologies.</p>

<p>Specialities include:- IT Infrastructure Software; Business Process Management; BI – Analytics, Reporting; Data Centre Automation; <span class="caps">EAI</span>; Middleware; <span class="caps">ESB</span>; Web Analytics; Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC); SaaS &amp; Cloud Vendors; Systems Integration; Application    Integration; Data Integration; Performance Management; Security Software – (Encryption, Endpoint, <span class="caps">ESSO</span>); Virtualization; Grid; <span class="caps">SOA</span> and WebServices; Distributed Caching; Emerging vendors in Event Driven Architecture and Space Based Architecture.</p>

<h2><span class="underline">What we don’t do</span></h2>

<p>You are a talented professional and you expect an agency to respect your details and not send them speculatively across the industry.</p>

<p>You’d like a full pre interview briefing with plenty of background information on the company and the job opportunity.  You would like to have an understanding of the clients’ recruitment process so we can navigate it successfully. You would like feedback, your calls returned promptly and to be kept updated. We do not push for information on your other interviews and then put candidates in to compete against you.</p>
