<p class="start">The market is littered (I use the phrase carefully) with ‘recruiters’ that quite frankly add no value. Justine has restored my faith that there are those who justify calling it a ‘profession’. Justine is one of the few head-hunters who you can discuss your needs in depth, gain valuable advice on the hiring process and obtain and advanced insight into the candidates themselves. I admire her intelligence, have come to trust her judgment and respect her capabilities. I will be using Justine in the future<span class="end">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="start">In an industry that is populated by a high percentage of people who overpromise and under deliver, Justine stands head and shoulders above anyone else I have ever encountered. She does what she says she will do and invariably the outcome is substantially better than she indicates. Her knowledge of the IT world, the players, the movers and shakers, who is worth knowing and who isn’t, is jaw dropping. Ask her any question and you will get <span class="caps">THE</span> definitive answer. From a candidate’s perspective she provides a level of support and service that no-one else can match and always, always has time for you. She is determined, persistent and persuasive and often demonstrates that she understands the candidate’s capabilities better than they do. Above all she is 100% reliable and trustworthy – a real, “proper” decent person. And I am not the only one who thinks this – everyone I know who has dealt with her is equally fulsome in their praise for her knowledge and abilities. I am completely certain that as her client, you would receive a first class service. I cannot recommend her too highly<span class="end">.</span></p>

<p class="start">How do you express in a few words, how someone is simply in a different league to all her peers ? Justine is not a ‘recruiter’ – and certainly not a ‘head-hunter’. She is – a total and consummate professional, a truly great Lady, and ( dare I say) friend. I Trust few others as much<span class="end">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="start">I’ve contracted Justine as recruiter for the past 15 years. For each assignment she gained an immediate and intimate understanding of our requirements and with her extensive knowledge of UK personnel ensured that any candidates were extremely well qualified and worthwhile. Overall a high value/high integrity business associate<span class="end">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="start">I have known of Justine for many years but it is only over the last 2 years that have we had conducted business together. Justine has a great reputation and having recently worked with Justine I now understand why. Justine is knowledgeable, reliable and has a great work ethic. I thoroughly recommend Justine to an employer or anybody that is looking for a change in career<span class="end">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="start">Justine is a fantastic recruiter, she understands the market, the companies she works for &amp; the job specification before she researches and finds only the best candidates for you to review! I have had the pleasure of using Justine to help build my team, as well as having being placed in to a position by her – she is always professional, personable and I look forward to working with her again<span class="end">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="start">I can recommend Justine without hesitation. I have known her for many years and not only is she highly professional, responsive and able to tap into a great network through her undoubtedly rich knowledge of the IT industry but is also that rarest of finds, a recruiter that genuinely cares for the long-term needs of candidates and client’s alike<span class="end">.</span></p>

<p class="start">I have worked with Justine on a number of occasions over many years and she is always able to find good people quickly and efficiently. I would not hesitate to recommend her work<span class="end">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="start">If you want the best person for the job, you must talk to Justine. I have not worked with a better recruitment partner in my twenty years in the business. She has an extraordinary network, developed through many years of selflessly putting long term relationships ahead of short term profits, and knows her business inside out. I have found her judicious, trustworthy, generous approach invaluable, and I look forward to working with her again soon<span class="end">.</span></p>
