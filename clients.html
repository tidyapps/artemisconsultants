      <p>Artemis has over 20 years experience of recruiting the best Software Sales and Technical Personnel for Software Vendors and Consultancies. Clients include many of the Gartner “Cool Vendors” and some of the most interesting, emerging start–ups in the US with a mission to build revenue and extend their market reach across UK and Europe. We have long established recruitment partnerships with established Enterprise Software Vendors as well as key players in Open Source and SaaS.</p>

<p>Our recruitment methodology is different to most agencies who work on a numbers game and rely heavily on advertising to source candidates. Most of the innovative Vendors we work for require a highly specific skill set for mission critical hires in Europe. The best talent out there rarely responds to web advertising and rarely puts their CV on a job board’s database. They don’t need to because they are well known in their area of specialisation, highly regarded by their peers and highly reference-able These candidates are the people you need to source for your companies growth and future development. These candidates will network extensively and use a trusted recruitment partner like Artemis who understands their target market to help them identify their next career challenge.</p>

<p>Artemis’s extensive and niche Software Industry Networks provide clients with a competitive advantage to recruit the best talent in the relevant “unadvertised” markets and reach out to the key individuals with the specific experience and track record your team needs to hire for success</p>

<p>Quality, trust and integrity are the centre of everything we do. The majority of our business and the majority of our candidates come to us through direct recommendation.</p>
